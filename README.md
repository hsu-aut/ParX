# ParX- An Ontology for Parameters and their Interdependencies in Manufacturing Processes
In contemporary manufacturing, the escalation of automation has become a defining trend. This progression entails the utilization of increasingly sophisticated equipment to uphold stringent product standards. Compounded by factors such as the escalating demand for sustainability and the accelerated obsolescence of products, the need for recurrent reconfiguration or complete redesign of manufacturing processes has become a common occurrence.

The semantic model developed to encapsulate the influences of process parameters and their interdependencies. Our approach leverages Ontology Design Patterns, integrating reusable terminology and logic gleaned from industrial standards.
